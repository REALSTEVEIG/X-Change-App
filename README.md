 Using nodemailer to send personalized emails to clients.
 
My goal for this project was to develop a system which would instantly communicate with a client in seconds and in the same light, return feedback to the server/service provider. I believe that the use cases of Nodemailer module cannot be  overemphasized and I intend to build more complexity with the ideas I have learnt from building this project
